# Intellectual Asset Token (IAT)

## Overview

The Intellectual Asset Token (IAT) is a Clarity smart contract designed to tokenize and manage intellectual property (IP) assets on the Stacks blockchain. This contract provides a comprehensive solution for fractional IP ownership, valuation tracking, and licensing through an advanced escrow mechanism.

## Key Features

### 1. IP Ownership Tokenization
- Register intellectual property assets
- Mint fractional tokens representing ownership
- Track initial and current asset valuation

### 2. Token Transfer Mechanism
- Transfer fractional IP tokens between holders
- Maintain a list of token holders (up to 10)
- Implement transfer restrictions based on asset properties

### 3. Licensing Escrow System
- Create licensing agreements with escrow protection
- Deposit and refund licensing fees
- Verify and confirm licensing conditions
- Manage licensing duration and fee settlement

## Contract Functions

### Ownership and Token Management
- `register-ip-ownership`: Register a new IP asset and mint tokens
- `transfer-ip-tokens`: Transfer fractional tokens between holders
- `update-asset-valuation`: Update asset valuation (restricted to owner/contract owner)

### Licensing Mechanisms
- `create-licensing-escrow`: Initiate a licensing agreement
- `deposit-licensing-fee`: Deposit licensing fee into escrow
- `confirm-license-conditions`: Confirm and release funds
- `refund-licensing-fee`: Refund fees if conditions are not met

### Read-Only Functions
- `get-token-balance`: Retrieve token balance for a specific holder
- `get-asset-details`: Retrieve details of a registered asset
- `get-licensing-escrow-details`: Retrieve licensing escrow information

## Security Features
- Input validation for all critical functions
- Access control for sensitive operations
- Escrow mechanism to protect both licensors and licensees
- Limit on token holder list size
